Fiddy.css: The CSS framework for people who know how to write CSS
=========

The grid system I use for personal projects. Not a fan of Foundation and Bootstrap grids because they don't give enough fine tuned abilities to create every part of your layout. Completely fluid, and is percentage-based rather than on arbitrary columns. Infinitely nestable. The idea is that you can just use this as a starting point for your projects.

It requires SASS and Compass to be used. I still want to build this up to be responsibe, but for now, just write your own rules.
